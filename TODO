- Maybe implement DB::BulkDeleteForRange(start_key, end_key)
  that would blow away files whose ranges are entirely contained
  within [start_key..end_key]?  For Chrome, deletion of obsolete
  object stores, etc. can be done in the background anyway, so
  probably not that important.
- There have been requests for MultiGet.

After a range is completely deleted, what gets rid of the
corresponding files if we do no future changes to that range.  Make
the conditions for triggering compactions fire in more situations?



Current Change 0905
[1] using key granularity to judge whether a sst is hot or not in Log
[2] also considering about range, density(keynums/range) as Log PickUp rules 
[3] waiting to be done:
       pick up hot keys within a sst, and organize them to become a new sst maintained in log

Current Change 0914
[1] stable version of key/table mixed log (take care of the lock, it would throw exception if lock is prohibited)
[2] waited to be added read logic

Current Change 0923
[1] read write performance is accepectable but performance with key log is unsolved
[2] a quite important version of this research

Current Change 1016
[1] Read&Write performance enhance
[2] Stable= version for testing
[3] need to find the best workload which can show the best enhancement .
